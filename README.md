# My Quest

Life is the greatest quest, and this is mine. I will document high-level resources \(such as aggregators\) to go to that I've found rather than the content itself. An aggregator of aggregators.

## Setup

We use [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) because we don't want to write yet another interface.

This is based on node so install `gitbook-cli`:

```
npm install gitbook-cli
```

Development:

```
./node_modules/.bin/gitbook serve

./node_modules/.bin/gitbook build
```
