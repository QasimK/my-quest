# Known Bad Actors

* Gmail has sent me multiple emails titled "you're not using the official Gmail app", with no way to stop them.
  * "Welcome to Google on your new Apple iPhone. Take the final steps to finish setting up your Apple iPhone by downloading these official Google apps." After re-authenticating Google \(mail\) account.
* LinkedIn has sent me multiple unsolicited emails, often relating to people I have never heard of.
* [Apple is monopolistic](https://www.timetoplayfair.com/timeline/), and deliberately undermines competion against itself in ways that are deeply harmful to customers. As a user of Spotify, I noticed and _hated_ many of the things that were pointed out in this article.
* I'm not touching Netflix because they only provide 720p for Firefox on Linux in 2019 \(and counting\).

## Other

* [Quora hoards knowledge](https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora/) despite asking for community contributions.
