# Tracking

## Card

A merchant can obviously track you using loyalty cards and your personal profile.

They can also track you using your (anonymised) card number.

For example, a supermarket can link together all of your grocery purchases
to your anonymous profile.

It can likely be deanonymised really easily.

Visa and Mastercard may not know your personal information? Amex does.

Visa and Mastercard offer "anonymised", aggregated information analysis.
