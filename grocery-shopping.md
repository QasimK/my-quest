\(It would be nice if it was labelled.\)

* Red Meat has extensive emissions \(less efficient; methene from rumination\), followed by chicken and dairy
* Foreign _fragile_ fruit/vegetables like blueberries or grapes are shipped by plane which have large emissions
* Foreign _durable_ fruit/vegetables like apples or bananas are shipped on low-emission ships
  * These may still be polluting
* Foreign fragile fruit/vegetables are flown in which is awful.
