# Surviving Consumerism

Many services very much want us for their own purposes, this page deals a collection of survival tips.

The main problem is that you are **out-numbered** \(better/correct term required\): One corporation taking a well-thought out action, spending 1000 hours on it, completely out-classes you in terms of effort and quality. For example, a party election manifesto may be dozens of pages long, expecting every voter to read every manifesto and then analyse and compare them is ridiculous. It only has to be written once, but each individual has to deal with it. However, the electorate may uses other sources of information which \(hopefully/in theory/...\) distill and compare the information for you into a bite-sized chunk that you can act upon.
